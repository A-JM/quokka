# Quokka Introduction

Quokka is meant to a next-generation data processing system that makes it very easy to run high-performance data analytics in Python from single node to cloud-scale clusters. Quokka's design is heavily influenced by systems that have come before, including Spark, Flink, Dask and Tensorflow.

Similar to how Spark exposes (or used to expose) a low-level RDD API and a high-level dataframe API, and how Tensorflow exposes lower-level graph construction APIs and high-level Keras/Estimator APIs, Quokka exposes a lower-level runtime API as well as high-level APIs to support common operations in SQL/Pandas style analytics, machine learning and graph analytics.
